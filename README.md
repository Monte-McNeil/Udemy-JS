# Udemy-JS
Repository of all my Udemy Coding Challenges &amp; Projects

This #1 selling Udemy course titled: "The Complete JavaScript Course 2021" has 68 hours of total video and 314 lectures to complete. Throughout the course you get plenty of chances to implement what you're learning with coding challenges, code along projects, and multiple PDF's full of practice problems. It dives into fundamentals for beginners, but also more advanced topics such as JavaScript with ES6, how Javascript works behind the scenes (engines, the call stack, this keyword), and Object Oriented Programming. 

DISCLAIMER: All of the projects in this course are code along format, I would be given starter code with the HTML and CSS already completed. I do not take any credit for the code written, even the JavaScript. It was purely educational based projects with the instructor doing most of the heavy lifting.
